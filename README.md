This project aims to detect whether an audio file is genuine (bonafide) or fake (spoofed), specifically targeting deepfake audio.
The system uses machine learning to classify audio inputs and predict whether the audio is manipulated or authentic. 
The web-based application allows users to upload an audio file and receive real-time predictions about its authenticity.
